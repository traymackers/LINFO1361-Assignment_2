Answer to the questions by adding text in the boxes. You may answer in either \textbf{French or English}. Do not modify anything else in the template.  The size of the boxes indicate the place you \textbf{can} use, but you \textbf{need not} use all of it (it is not an indication of any expected length of answer). \textbf{Be as concise as possible! A good short answer is better than a lot of nonsense!}
